## Description

This website was for an assignment the second semester project. It was assigned by Noroff school of technology and digital media.

"An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings."

The assignment was to create a online auction website where users could register new accounts and bit on items on the site. The API functionality is handled by an existing application.
